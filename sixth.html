                        I love how we all lied that we can't do ice skating üòÇ, but you are so good tho, you skate like you're dancing.

                <div>The day we watched movies soundtrack orchestra! I almost cried when How To Train Your Dragon ost got played. Thank you love, for inviting me to watch the orchestra‚ò∫Ô∏è. The venue was soo beautiful but not as beautiful as you (cailah gombal mulu). I thoroughly enjoyed the concert even tho we're not seating right side of each other but at least I can choke you from behindüòà </div>
                <div>The last day we hangout together before I went to Melbourne. Even tho, we hungout for 12+ hours it feels like it's not enough. If I have the option to just be with you 24/7 I'd choose that no hesitation, but ig money doesn't grow on tree right? That's why I'm going to work hard so we can afford to just be together. Hey, but at least, we got to make a handshake right?</div>
